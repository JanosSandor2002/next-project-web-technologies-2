# Web Technologies 2 – Next.js Project

## Project Overview

This project is being developed for the **Web Technologies 2** course.  
The goal is to build a full-stack web application using Next.js, integrating frontend, backend, and database functionality within a single modern web framework.

The application demonstrates practical usage of full-stack web development concepts learned during the course.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js – Full-stack React framework
- React – Frontend UI development
- Node.js – Server-side runtime
- Database system (e.g., MongoDB / PostgreSQL)
- REST API routes (Next.js API routes or Route Handlers)
- ORM / Database client (if applicable)

## Project Structure

The project includes:

### Frontend

- Dynamic pages
- Reusable components
- Client-side and server-side rendering
- Form handling and validation

### Backend

- API endpoints implemented within Next.js
- Request handling (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Business logic layer

### Database

- Persistent data storage
- Data models / schemas
- CRUD operations

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate full-stack development using Next.js
- Implement proper separation between frontend and backend logic
- Connect the application to a database
- Perform CRUD operations
- Apply best practices in web development
